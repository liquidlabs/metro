- **Enhancement:** Allow `@Binds` and `@Multibinds` functions to be private.
- **Enhancement:** Allow "static graphs" via companions implementing the graph interface itself.
- **Fix:** When recording IC lookups of overridable declarations, only record the original declaration and not fake overrides.

- **Fix:** Write `@Multibinds` information to metro metadata.
- **Fix:** Always write metro metadata to `@BindingContainer` classes, even if empty.

0.5.1
-----

_2025-07-18_

- **Breaking change:** Rename the `generateHintProperties` Gradle DSL property to `generateContributionHints`.

- **Enhancement:** Add a new Metro option `warnOnInjectAnnotationPlacement` to disable suggestion to lift @Inject to class when there is only one constructor, the warning applies to constructors with params too.
- **Fix:** Fix `@Contributes*.replaces` not working if the contributed type is in the same compilation but a different file.
- **Fix:** Fix generated `MembersInjector.create()` return types' generic argument to use the target class.

0.5.0
-----

_2025-07-14_

- **New:** Experimental support for "binding containers" via `@BindingContainer`. See [their docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/dependency-graphs#binding-containers) for more details.
- **New:** Add `keys-scopedProviderFields-*.txt` and `keys-providerFields-*.txt` reports to see generated field reports for graphs.
- **Enhancement:** Remove `Any` constraint from `binding<T>()`, allowing bindings to satisfy nullable variants.
- **Enhancement:** Add diagnostic to check for scoped `@Binds` declarations. These are simple pipes and should not have scope annotations.
- **Enhancement:** Move graph dependency cycle checks to earlier in validation.
- **Enhancement:** When using Dagger interop, default `allowEmpty` to true when using Dagger's `@Multibinds` annotation.
- **Enhancement:** Make Dagger interop providers/lazy instances a `dagger.internal.Provider` internally for better compatibility with Dagger internals. Some dagger-generated code assumes this type at runtime.
- **Enhancement:** Support javax/jakarta `Provider` types as multibinding Map value types when Dagger interop is enabled.
- **Enhancement:** Completely skip processing local and enum classes as they're irrelevant to Metro's compiler.
- **Enhancement:** When reporting `@Binds` declarations in binding stacks, report the original declaration rather than inherited fake overrides.
- **Enhancement:** Add interop support for kotlin-inject's `@AssistedFactory` annotations.
- **Enhancement:** Add diagnostic to check for graph classes directly extending other graph classes. You should use `@Extends`.
- **Enhancement:** Add diagnostic to check for `@Assisted` parameters in provides functions.
- **Enhancement:** Add diagnostic to check duplicate `@Provides` declaration names in the same class.
- **Fix:** Within (valid) cycles, topographically sort bindings within the cycle. Previously these would fall back to a deterministic-but-wrong alphabetical sort.
- **Fix:** Handle enum entry arguments to qualifier, scope, and map key annotations.
- **Fix:** Report the original location of declarations in fake overrides in error reporting.
- **Fix:** Handle default values on provides parameters with absent bindings during graph population.
- **Fix:** Don't try to read private accessors of `@Includes` parameters.

- **Fix:** Fix supporting overloads of binds functions from parent graphs or external supertypes.
- **Fix:** Fix generating binding functions with names that contain dashes.
- **Fix:** Treat interop'd Dagger/Anvil/KI components as implicitly extendable.

- **Enhancement**: Rewrite graph resolution using topological sorting to vastly improve performance and simplify generation.

0.3.0
-----

_2025-05-05_

- **New**: Add support for `@ContributesGraphExtension`! See the [docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/dependency-graphs#contributed-graph-extensions) for more info.
- **New**: Add a `asContribution()` compiler intrinsic to upcast graphs to expected contribution types. For example: `val contributedInterface = appGraph.asContribution<ContributedInterface>()`. This is validated at compile-time.
- **New**: Automatically transform `@Provides` functions to be `private`. This is enabled by defaults and supersedes the `publicProviderSeverity` when enabled, and can be disabled via the Gradle extension or `transform-providers-to-private` compiler option. Note that properties and providers with any annotations with `KClass` arguments are not supported yet pending upstream kotlinc changes.
- **Enhancement**: Rewrite the internal `BindingGraph` implementation to be more performant, accurate, and testable.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that graph factories don't provide their target graphs as parameters.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that a primary scope is defined if any additionalScopes are also defined on a graph annotation.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to validate that contributed types do not have narrower visibility that aggregating graphs. i.e. detect if you accidentally try to contribute an `internal` type to a `public` graph.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize supertype lookups when building binding classes by avoiding previously visited classes.
- **Enhancement**: Don't generate hints for contributed types with non-public API visibility.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting duplicate binding errors where one of the bindings is contributed, report the contributing class in the error message.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting scope incompatibility, check any extended parents match the scope and suggest a workaround in the error diagnostic.
- **Enhancement**: Allow AssistedFactory methods to be protected.
- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when a parent graph or supertype modifies/removes a provider.
- **Fix**: Fix rank processing error when the outranked binding is contributed using Metro's ContributesBinding annotation.
- **Fix**: Fix `@Provides` graph parameters not getting passed on to extended child graphs.

- **Fix**: Fix race condition in generating parent graphs first even if child graph is encountered first in processing.
- **Fix**: Fallback `AssistedInjectChecker` error report to the declaration source.
- **Fix**: Fix missing parent supertype bindings in graph extensions.
- **Change**: `InstanceFactory` is no longer a value class. This wasn't going to offer much value in practice.

- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostics for multibindings with star projections.

0.1.3
-----

_2025-04-18_

- **New**: Write graph metadata to reports (if enabled).
- **New**: Support configuring debug and reports globally via `metro.debug` and `metro.reportsDestination` Gradle properties (respectively).

- **Enhancement**: Report error diagnostic if Dagger's `@Reusable` is used on a provider or injected class.
- **Enhancement**: Tweak diagnostic error strings for members so that IDE terminals auto-link them better. i.e., instead of printing `example.AppGraph.provideString`, Metro will print `example.AppGraph#provideString` instead.

- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when `@Includes`-annotated graph parameters change accessor signatures.

- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling Javax/Jakarta/Dagger providers from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling `dagger.Lazy` from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Preserve the original `Provider` or `Lazy` type used in injected types when generating factory creators.
- Temporarily disable hint generation in WASM targets to avoid file count mismatches until [KT-75865](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-75865).
- Add an Android sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/android-app
- Add a multiplatform Circuit sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/circuit-app
