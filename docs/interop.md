# Interop

## Annotations

Metro supports user-defined annotations for common annotations. This means that a user doesn’t necessarily have to use Metro’s annotations if they’re introducing it to an existing codebase. Support varies depending on the annotation’s use case.

Compile-only annotations are mostly supported. This includes the following:

* `@AssistedFactory`
* `@AssistedInject`
* `@Assisted`
* `@BindsInstance`
* `@Binds`
* `@ContributesBinding`
* `@ContributesTo`
* `@DependencyGraph.Factory`
* `@DependencyGraph`
* `@ElementsIntoSet`
* `@Inject`
* `@IntoMap`
* `@IntoSet`
* `@MapKey`
* `@Module`
* `@Multibinds`
* `@Provides`
* `@Qualifier`
* `@Scope`

These are configurable via Metro’s Gradle extension.

```kotlin
metro {
  interop {
    assisted.add("dagger/assisted/Assisted")
  }
}
```

For Dagger and KI specifically, there are convenience helper functions.

```kotlin
metro {
  interop {
    includeDagger()
    includeKotlinInject()
    includeAnvil()
  }
}
```

`@DependencyGraph` is replaceable but your mileage may vary if you use Anvil or modules, since Metro’s annotation unifies Anvil’s `@MergeComponent` functionality and doesn’t support modules.

Similarly, `@ContributesBinding` is replaceable but there are not direct analogues for Anvil’s `@ContributesMultibinding` or kotlin-inject-anvil’s `@ContributesBinding(multibinding = …)` as these annotations are implemented as `@ContributesInto*` annotations in Metro.

`binding` in Metro uses a more flexible mechanism to support generics, but interop with Anvil's `boundType: KClass<*>` property is supported.

## Components

Metro graphs can interop with components generated by Dagger and Kotlin-Inject. These work exclusively through their public accessors and can be depended on like any other graph dependency.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface MetroGraph {
  val message: String

  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(
      @Includes daggerComponent: DaggerComponent
    ): MetroGraph
  }
}

@dagger.Component
interface DaggerComponent {
  val message: String

  @dagger.Component.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(@Provides message: String): DaggerComponent
  }
}
```

Conversely, kotlin-inject and Dagger components can also depend on Metro graphs.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface MessageGraph {
  val message: String

  // ...
}

// Dagger
@Component(dependencies = [MessageGraph::class])
interface DaggerComponent {
  val message: String

  @Component.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(messageGraph: MessageGraph): DaggerComponent
  }
}

// kotlin-inject
@Component
abstract class KotlinInjectComponent(
  @Component val messageGraph: MessageGraph
) {
  abstract val message: String
}
```

## Runtime

Enabling dagger interop also enables more advanced _runtime_ interop with Dagger/Javax/Jakarta's `Provider`/`Lazy` types.

```kotlin
metro {
  interop {
    includeDagger()
  }
}
```

This specifically enables two features.

1. Interop with Dagger/Javax/Jakarta's `Provider` and `Lazy` runtime intrinsics.
2. Interop with generated Dagger factories for constructor-injected classes, assisted-injected classes, and Dagger modules. This means that an upstream class or module that was processed with the dagger compiler and has a generated Java _factory_ class can be natively reused by Metro.

Note this also automatically adds an extra `interop-dagger` dependency to support this scenario.
